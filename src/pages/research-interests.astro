        Children are spending more time interacting with adults and technology, and less time interacting with peers.
        Importantly, when children interact with peers, they co-construct knowedge with an intellecual equal. In contrast,
        adult-directed activities and virtual environments lead to more passive forms of learning.
        As a result, these acute changes to childhood may have important implications for children's cooperation,
        learning, exploration, and idea-generation. My research aims to understand how these shifts impact children's social and
        cognitive development, with the ultimate goal of informing educational practices and parenting strategies.

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>How does adult presence and direction shape children's exploration and cooperative learning?</li>
      <li>What is the variability across children's information processing,
        construction, and discovery? How do acute changes to childhood shape this variability?
      </li>
          How does living in a virtual environment impact children's social learning and cognitive flexibility?

        Bayesian learning can explain remarkably complex real-world inference, but it is less clear where new priors
        originate. Babies and young children constantly generate fresh hypotheses about the world. How do they do this
        so effectively? And how might treating Bayesian learning as a developmentally conditioned process—shaped by
        agentic exploration, social interaction, and maturation—help explain the origins of creative ideas?
