  </div>

    <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Children are spending more time interacting with adults and technology, and less time playing with peers.
    These acute changes to childhood may have important implications for children's development of cooperation, learning, and exploration.
    My research aims to understand how these shifts impact children's social and cognitive development, 
    with the ultimate goal of informing educational practices and parenting strategies.

  </div>

  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Adults tend to converge on the right way to do something. 
    To our detriment, we pre-screen possibilities through the lens of practicality. 
    On the other hand, children explore the hypothesis space without regard for reality. 
    <b>What if adults could be a little more like children?<b> Would we be more creative, imaginative, and innovative?
    Would we generate more great ideas?. 
  </div>

  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Many of our best ideas come when we least expect them. 
    The harder we look, the more elusive creative solutions seem to become. But,
    <b>what if we could use computational models to predict moments of insight?<b> 
    Could we reliably produce great ideas?
