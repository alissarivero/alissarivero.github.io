            Children are spending more time interacting with adults and technology, and less time interacting with peers.
            Importantly, when children interact with peers, they co-construct knowedge with an intellecual equal. In contrast,
            adult-directed activities and virtual environments lead to more passive forms of learning.
            As a result, these acute changes to childhood may have important implications for children's cooperation,
            learning, exploration, and idea-generation. My research aims to understand how these shifts impact children's social and
            cognitive development, with the ultimate goal of informing educational practices and parenting strategies.

            Bayesian learning can explain remarkably complex real-world inference, but it is less clear where new priors
            originate. Babies and young children constantly generate fresh hypotheses about the world. How do they do this
            so effectively? And how might treating Bayesian learning as a developmentally conditioned process (shaped by
            agentic exploration, social interaction, and maturation) help explain the origins of creative ideas?

            <li>Many of our best ideas come when we least expect them. The harder we look, the more elusive creative solutions seem to become. But, what if we could use computational models to predict moments of insight? Could we reliably produce great ideas?</li>
