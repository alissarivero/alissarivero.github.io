  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Adults tend to converge on the right way to do something. 
    To our detriment, we pre-screen possibilities through the lens of practicality. 
    On the other hand, children explore the hypothesis space without regard for reality. 
    What if we could be a little more like themâ€”would we be more creative, imaginative, and innovative? 
    Would we generate more great ideas?. 
  </div>

  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Many of our best ideas come when we least expect them. 
    The harder we look, the more elusive creative solutions seem to become. But,
    what if we could predict moments of insight through computational modeling? 
    Could we reliably produce great ideas?
