        Children are spending more time interacting with adults and technology, and less time playing with peers.
        These acute changes to childhood may have important implications for children's development of cooperation,
        learning, and exploration. My research aims to understand how these shifts impact children's social and
        cognitive development, with the ultimate goal of informing educational practices and parenting strategies.

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Which changes (time with peers, adult-directed time, tech exposure) matter most for cooperation and exploration?</li>
      <li>When in development are these effects largest, and are they reversible with targeted interventions?</li>
      <li>How do school and family contexts buffer or amplify these shifts?</li>

        Bayesian learning can explain remarkably complex real-world inference, but it is less clear where new priors
        originate. Babies and young children constantly generate fresh hypotheses about the world. How do they do this
        so effectively? And how might treating Bayesian learning as a developmentally conditioned process—shaped by
        agentic exploration, social interaction, and maturation—help explain the origins of creative ideas?

        Adults converge on “the right way” and pre-screen options for practicality. Children explore the hypothesis
        space with fewer constraints. If adults behaved a bit more like children, would creativity and innovation
        increase?

        Many of our best ideas arrive when we least expect them. Can computational models predict moments of insight?
        Could we reliably produce great ideas?
