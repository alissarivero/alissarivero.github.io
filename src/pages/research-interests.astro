      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Background</h2>
      <p class="text-left leading-relaxed">
        Children are spending more time interacting with adults and technology, and less time with peers.
        When children interact with peers, they co-construct knowledge with an intellectual equal. In contrast,
        adult-directed activities and virtual environments can lead to more passive learning.
        These acute changes to childhood may affect cooperation, learning, exploration, and idea-generation.
        My research examines these shifts to inform educational practices and parenting strategies.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>How does adult presence/direction shape children’s exploration and cooperative learning?</li>
        <li>How do acute changes to childhood modulate variability in discovery and construction?</li>
        <li>How does a more virtual environment impact social learning and cognitive flexibility?</li>

    <!-- Great Ideas card -->
    <HorizontalCard title="Where Do Great Ideas Come From?" img="/great_ideas.webp">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Background</h2>
      <p class="text-left leading-relaxed">
        Bayesian learning explains complex inference, but where do new priors/hypotheses originate?
        Children generate fresh hypotheses constantly. How do they do this so effectively?
        Treating Bayesian learning as developmentally conditioned—shaped by agentic exploration,
        social interaction, and maturation—may clarify the origins of creative ideas.
