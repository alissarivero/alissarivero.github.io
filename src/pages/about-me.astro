    Hi, my name is <b>Alissa</b>! I'm originally from Arlington, VA and now live in Durham, NC. 
    In my free time, I love trying new restaurants, drawing, and hanging out with my two dogs.
    During my time at Duke, I became deeply invested in <b>community engagement</b>.
    I founded New Neighbors Project, a student organization that pairs local refugee
    children with college student mentors. Furthermore, I assisted with Turquoise Parker's "Shark Tank" program at Lakewood Elementary, helping 
    children develop their own entrepreneurial ventures while learning important life skills---including how to
    pay taxes!! I'm also passionate about increasing access to housing, having worked with
    Duke Homebuyers Club and Habitat for Humanity. 
    I am currently applying to developmental psychology Ph.D. programs in hopes of becoming a tenure-track professor.
